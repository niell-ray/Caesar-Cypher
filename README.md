# Caesar-Cypher

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates the working of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption and decryption technique.

Features
	•	Encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift-based substitution method.
	•	Handles spaces, numbers, and special characters without modifying them.
	•	Allows users to continuously encode or decode messages until they choose to exit.

How It Works
	1.	Run the program.
	2.	Choose “encode” to encrypt a message or “decode” to decrypt.
	3.	Enter your message.
	4.	Provide a shift number (the number of positions each letter will be shifted in the alphabet).
	5.	View the encrypted or decrypted output.
	6.	Choose whether to continue or exit.

Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
3
Here is the encoded result: khoor
